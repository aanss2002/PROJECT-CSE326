<abbr>What it takes to become an athlete?</abbr>
<p>Athletes and sports competitors play in organized and officiated sports teams nationally or internationally, this can include a variety of sports such as basketball, baseball, weight lifting, tennis, golf, swimming, football, just to name a few. Many dream of becoming paid professional athletes, but in reality, only and few beat the odds to make a full time living of doing so.
Athletes and sports competitors are not required to have a particular level of education; however, many are recruited by colleges in the earlier stages of their career path in becoming a professional athlete. It takes years of practice and experience to become an athlete or sports competitor. Athletes must learn the rules of the game and develop their skills throughout their younger years competing in high school, collegiate athletics, or club teams, some even take private lessons or attend sporting camps.
Important qualities include athleticism, concentration, decision-making skills, dedication, eye hand coordination, stamina, and the ability to work well as a team player. The primary strengths to become a paid athlete or sports competitor are superior athletic talent and extensive knowledge of a chosen sport.

Athletes and sports competitors typically are developing and improving their athletic skills by training, exercising, and maintaining the physical and mental stamina. They take directions from team mates, coaches, and sporting staff regarding strategy and tactics. Often times they assess their individual or team performances after a game or sporting event to distinguish their strengths and weaknesses as well as their opponents.

Being an athlete involves more than competing in a professional sporting event. Most athletes spend the majority of their time practicing under the guidance of trainers and coaches. Competition at all levels is extremely intense and job security is always in question. Most athletes train throughout the year, even during the off season to maintain in peak physical condition, keep their form, and maintain or improve game techniques; there is very little downtime when competing at the professional level.

<abbr>What do I love about Sports</abbr><br>
<p>
 <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold">1.THEY HAVE OPTIMISTIC AND POSITIVE ATTITUDE<br>
<span style="color:gold"> With a positive attitude, success is not always guaranteed; however, you will perform poorly with a negative attitude and that’s guaranteed. Optimistic people on the other hand are more hard-working. They believe that they can achieve and therefore they do not quit. They recover quickly from their defeats as compared to pessimistic people. Pessimistic people give up quickly. They do not believe in themselves.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold">2.THEY HAVE COMPELLING VISION<br>
<span style="color:gold">To overcome the failures and to achieve your dreams, it is essential to have a compelling vision. A lot of athletes out there achieve success after failures due to their vision. They have a dream that motivates them to perform better. Without any specific goal or dream, you may get off track. It will eventually result in failure. You can’t hit a target when you do not know where it is and what it is.<br>
</p>
<p>

 <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold">3.THEY ARE EXTREMELY MOTIVATED<br>
<span style="color:gold">After you decide what you need to do, you must take certain actions and execute your plans. Without taking any sort of action, the motivation will not come. There is no use of vision if you do not take action. In addition to this, highly successful athletes find inspiration in the work they do. They love their sports, and therefore they are motivated by them. They are motivated by the improvement and the growth they experience in themselves. Athletes who have a growth mindset find motivation in improving themselves and becoming the best. <br>
</p>
<p>

<span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold">4.SET REALISTIC AND ACHIEVABLE GOALS<br>
<span style="color:gold">Setting up goals is considered to be the first step in the process of achieving success. Highly successful people, therefore, set realistic and achievable goals. They set goals as they provide them with a pathway to success and keep them on track throughout the journey. Goals keep successful athletes motivated. You need to think carefully and then decide on your goals. What would you be achieving in the time to come? When do you want to see yourself becoming successful? You should ask these sorts of questions yourself while setting up the goals. <br>
</p>
<p>

 <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold">5.SELF TALK<br>
<span style="color:gold">Self-talk is important. Not ordinary or negative self-talk, but positive self-talk is essential. It can be a game-changer. It can affect your performance as to how you play and perform, think, and feel. Self-talk can do wonders by replacing all of your fear with courage. <br>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold">6.VISUALIZATION<br>
<span style="color:gold">Successful athletes visualize themselves performing. They do mental rehearsal and imagine themselves playing and performing in the real world. They create scenarios and then challenge themselves. They find ways to do those challenges. In addition to this, visualization also gives you an edge over your competitor. You can simply take it as a practice. Similar to the physical practice, visualization is a mental practice that can help you perform better and ultimately make you successful. <br>
